# Code quality

```{seealso}
Complete [dev install](./development_setup) instructions before continuing.
```

We have several tools configured for checking code quality:

- Pre-commit checks run automatically at commit time.
  Install checks with `pre-commit install`.
  Run them manually with `pre-commit run --all-files`.
  **Will exit non-zero when finding errors or changing files.**

  - Ruff formats and lints (sometimes autofixes) Python code.

  - Generic pre-commit checks help avoid common mistakes like committing large
    files or trailing whitespace.

- Package scripts (defined in `package.json`) to check (and/or fix)
  TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, JSON, Markdown, and YAML.
  Run manually with `jlpm run lint`.
  **Will exit 0 when applying fixes.
  Check the logs and/or `git status` after every run.**

  - Prettier formats the file types listed above.

  - Eslint lints (sometimes autofixes) JS/TS code.

- UI tests using [Galata](https://github.com/jupyterlab/galata), defined in the
  `ui-tests/` directory. To run locally:

  ```bash
  cd ui-tests
  jlpm install  # If you haven't already
  jlpm playwright install  # if you haven't already
  jlpm run test
  ```

  - DOM testing: Interact with the application programmatically and verify
    resulting DOM looks correct.

  - Snapshot testing: Interact with the application programmatically and verify
    the resulting rendered content exactly matches snapshots in this
    repository.
    When snapshot tests fail, new snapshots can be generated by
    commenting `please update snapshots` in a PR or locally running
    `jlpm run test:update` from the `ui-tests/` directory.
    Please carefully verify the snapshot changes are as expected before merging.
