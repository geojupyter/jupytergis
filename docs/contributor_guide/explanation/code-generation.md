# Code generation

JupyterGIS leverages code generation to share information about data structures across
Python and TypeScript packages.

## Overview

There are 3 code generation targets: the schema registry, TypeScript types, and Python
types.

Code generation tasks are defined in `packages/schema/package.json`.
You can run all code generation tasks with `jlpm run build:schema`, or run them
individually using the commands in the diagram below.

## Schema registry

The schema registry is built for use in TypeScript code.
It's used by [`react-jsonschema-form` (RJSF)](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form)
to generate forms (React components) from JSONSchema.

Prior to generating the schema registry, we dereference (i.e. inline `$ref`s) our
schemas and combine them into one JSON file which contains a mapping from schema names
to schema data for each schema.

:::{note}
Combining the schemas into `forms.json` is vestigial.
Before we had a schema registry, we would directly index into this data to find a
schema.
Now that we're building a schema registry for interfacing with schemas, perhaps we don't
need a combined `forms.json` schema.

## TypeScript types

TypeScript types are generated from the JSONSchema files using
[`json-schema-to-typescript`](https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript).

We additionally run a custom script (`scripts/add-schema-version.ts`) to generate a
version number variable.

## Python types

Python types are generated from the JSONSchema files using
[`datamodel-code-generator`](https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator).

### Weirdness with `$ref` paths

Unfortunately, `datamodel-code-generator` expects `$ref` paths to be expressed
differently from `json-schema-to-typescript`.
The former expects "relative" paths, and the latter expects "absolute" paths.

For example, if we have two schema files:

```text
├── referent.json
└── subdir
    └── referrer.json
```

...`json-schema-to-typescript` would expect `referrer.json` to contain a reference like:

```json
"$ref": "referent.json",
```

...and `datamodel-code-generator` would expect the reference in `referrer.json` to look like:

```json
"$ref": "../referent.json",
```

**For this reason, we chose to write our schema files in the way
`json-schema-to-typescript` expects, and pre-process them into a temp directory so they
look the way `datamodel-code-generator` expects before generating Python types.**
