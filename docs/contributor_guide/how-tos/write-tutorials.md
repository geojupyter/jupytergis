# Write tutorials

This guide provides best practices for writing tutorials for JupyterGIS. To keep tutorials consistent and easy to follow, please follow the guidelines below.

- Each tutorial should start with:
  - A short introductory paragraph
  - A learning objectives box
  - A prerequisites box
- The tutorial should be divided into topics using headings and subheadings.
- For each topic, explanations can be written in paragraph form. When providing instructions, consider using a numbered list if there are a lot of steps to follow; otherwise a short paragraph can be used.
- The tutorial should be enriched with exercises using exercise and solution blocks.
