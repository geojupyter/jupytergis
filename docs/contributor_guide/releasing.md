# Releasing

## Automated Releases with `jupyter_releaser`

The recommended way to make a release is to use
[`jupyter_releaser`](https://jupyter-releaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/making_release_from_repo.html)
in GitHub Actions.
Follow the linked instructions.

**This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org)**.

:::{important}
Because this project is in early development, we **do not bump the major version number**.
Most changes are minor version bumps, even breaking changes.
See [the SemVer FAQ](https://semver.org/#how-should-i-deal-with-revisions-in-the-0yz-initial-development-phase) for more.

### Specifying a version spec

When prompted for a "New Version Specifier", the default value is `next`.
This will bump the packages as follows:

- `0.1.0a0` -> `0.1.0a1`
- `0.1.0b7` -> `0.1.0b8`
- `0.1.0` -> `0.1.1`

This is often **not** what we want.
To bump to another version, you can specify the Python version directly.
For example:

- `0.1.0b8`
- `0.4.0`
- `1.0.0`
- `1.2.0rc0`

You can also specify a version part, e.g.:

- `patch`
  - Would bump `0.3.0` -> `0.3.1`
- `minor`
  - Would bump `0.3.0` -> `0.4.0`
- `major`
  - Would bump `0.3.0` -> `1.0.0`
