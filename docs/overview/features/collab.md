# Collaborative Features

One of the standout features of JupyterGIS is its shared editing functionality, which **seamlessly connects users across different interfaces within the JupyterGIS ecosystem**. Whether collaborators are using the JupyterLab GIS extension, or working with the Python API in a Notebook, **any changes made to a shared document are instantly reflected for all users**.

For more details, please read our how-to document: [](#how-to-collab).

Note that currently, real-time collaboration is not supported in [JupyterLite](https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lite/lab/index.html).
