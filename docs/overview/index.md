# Overview

## ü§ù Real-time collaboration

JupyterGIS is designed to allow multiple people to work on the same geospatial project
simultaneously, facilitating discussion and collaboration around map layers, spatial
analyses, and other GIS data being developed.

Users can edit, visualize, and analyze spatial data together in real-time, share map
layers, and annotate directly within the JupyterLab environment, fostering efficient
teamwork on GIS projects.

## üîÑ QGIS project file support

JupyterGIS provides basic support for [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org) project files, allowing users to import and export
projects seamlessly between QGIS and JupyterLab.
This compatibility preserves layer styles, data sources, and project settings, enabling smooth transitions between GIS work
in QGIS and collaborative, cloud-based work in JupyterLab.

## üêç Python integration

Python users can further extend JupyterGIS workflows by integrating with Python geospatial libraries, such as GeoPandas, Xarray
and Rasterio, to perform custom analyses and automate processes.
Together, these features make JupyterGIS a powerful tool for
both collaborative mapping and in-depth geospatial analysis.
