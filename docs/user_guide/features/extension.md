# JupyterLab Extension

JupyterGIS comes with a JupyterLab extension that embeds QGIS features directly into the JupyterLab UI.
This extension allows you to:

- Open `.qgz` and `` .jGIS` `` files in JupyterLab
- Create new `.jGIS` files
- Edit those files by adding new vector or raster layers, modifying geometries, and performing spatial operations.
