# Installing JupyterGIS

```````{tabs}

``````{group-tab} Mamba (recommended)

:::{note}
It is best to install JupyterGIS using `mamba`, `conda`, `micromamba`, or `pixi` since you'll be able to install `qgis` at the same time, allowing you to open `.qgz` files.
:::

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge jupytergis qgis
```
``````

``````{group-tab} pip

:::{warning}
When installing with `pip`, QGIS compatibility functions won't work out of the box.
You're on your own!
:::

```bash
pip install jupytergis
```
``````

```````

Once JupyterGIS is installed, start JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

## Quickstart

Here are a few neat options to quickstart in an ephemeral environment:

```````{tabs}
``````{group-tab} Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/geojupyter/jupytergis:latest
```
``````

``````{group-tab} Pixi
[Pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi)

```bash
pixi exec --spec jupytergis --spec qgis jupyter lab
```
``````

``````{group-tab} uv
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

```bash
uv run --with jupytergis jupyter lab
```
``````
