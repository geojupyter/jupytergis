Basic Usage
===========

JupyterGIS provides a Python API that can be used for opening QGIS projects,
add raster or vector layers and apply filtering.

You can open an existing QGIS project and **display it in your Jupyter Notebook**:

.. code-block:: Python

    from jupytergis import GISDocument

    doc = GISDocument('file.qgz')

    doc

**Opening an existing file connects you to the fileâ€™s collaborative session**,
meaning that anyone working on the same QGIS project file, whether through the
JupyterLab extension or the Python API, will see the edits you make.

Creating a ``GISDocument`` object without providing a path to an existing file would create a
new empty document:

.. code-block:: Python

    from jupytergis import GISDocument

    doc = GISDocument()

    doc

Once the document is opened/created, you can start creating GIS layers.
