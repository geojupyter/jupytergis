    "## What is \"The Map\" in a Geographic Information System (GIS) context?\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional geography, a **map** is a picture that shows the layout of some part of the world — things like roads, rivers, buildings, or population data, all drawn at a certain scale and intended to illustrate or enable something specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in **digital mapping** (or Geographic Information Systems, GIS), a map is much more than just a picture — it's made up of **data** that can be viewed, edited, analyzed, and combined with other data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In GIS software like **JupyterGIS**, a digital map is actually a **document** that holds:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Layers** — These are pieces of data, like roads, rivers, or land use. Each layer represents one kind of thing or phenomenon, in the physical world.\n",
    "- **Basemaps** — These are background images, like satellite imagery or street maps, that help give context to your data layers.\n",
    "- **Tools** — Things that let you analyze or edit the layers on your map.\n",

    "## Dana Tomlin's Cartographic Model (Simplified)\n",
    "\n",
    "In his foundational work [GIS & Cartographic Modeling](https://archive.org/details/geographicinform00toml), Dana Tomlin, one of the founders of modern GIS, described the **Cartographic Model** as a way to think of maps not just as images, but as **tools for thinking and analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In his model:\n",
    "> A map is not just a picture of the world, but a **set of layers of data** that can be combined using logic and rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, each layer on the map has meaning — and by combining layers in specific ways we can answer questions like:\n",
    "- Where is the best place to build a school?\n",
    "- Which areas are at risk of flooding?\n",
    "- How has a city's land use changed over time?"

    "1. `from jupytergis import GISDocument`\n",
    "   This line tells Python to load the `GISDocument` module from the `jupytergis` library. Think of the `GISDocument` module as the part of the pre-written JupyterGIS code that creates your digital map container in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `doc = GISDocument(\"local.jGIS\")`\n",
    "   This defines a variable called `doc` to store the command that will import the file `local.jGIS` as the `GISDocument`.\n",
    "   This document is where you'll add your layers (roads, rivers, buildings, etc.) and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `doc`\n",
    "   When you type this in a notebook cell and run it, it runs the module `GISDocument` to create an interactive map in your notebook, using the `local.jGIS` file. You can then later add layers, change the basemap, and do spatial analysis. You *could* use the complete command `GISDocument(\"local.jGIS\")` to run the GISModule, but storing the command in a short variable (like, `doc`) allows you to easily reuse the command, with less text, in your code. \n",

    "\n",
    "This is like opening a new document in Word or Google Docs — but instead of writing an essay, you're going to build and explore a map!"
